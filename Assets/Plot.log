We survived.          \n
Neither of us remember what happened.     \n
Mechanic said this is not a ship in the ordinary sense of the word,      but a detached turret. He had to disassemble a second gun.   And we have an engine now...     kind of.    \n\n
They say I am a pilot and look at me expectantly.      \n
Ok than...

Ship 2
He said better dynamics, speed is increased he said.   \n

Ship 3
We got ourself a shield. It was damaged badly, but the guy got it working.

Ship 4
We ll call him "Retro", said Bob. Now it's time to honour a tradition.   \n
- You don't mean that one?   \n
- Exactly. \n
- Not a chance! We might need...\n
He pressed the button.   Old ship was torn to pieces by a powerful explosion.   \n
...   \n
...   \n
- Was that our fuel that you blew up?  \n
- Of course not!     I've overloaded the shield.  \n
- You what!?  \n
- You ll have a new one in no time.  At least I hope so.

Ship 5
I'm starting to have a flashbacks. All of them end with a flash of light. The rest is a blur.

Ship 6
Bob said I would love the changes.   \n
Rockets! I   love   rockets. \n
He is forgiven.

Level 1
Seems no one waited for us here.  Mostly rocks around.   \n 
Angry rocks.

51
Level 1 cleared
These strange shiny capsules seem to be attracted to us.   But even if we miss some of them, later they are nowhere to be found.   \n
Somehow I feel right about it.

52
Level 2.
It just occurred to me that Bob felt familiar from the start. I almost knew his next crazy idea before him.    \n
I wonder if I ever saw Samanta before.

53
Level 2 cleared
I hear happy voices each time the sparks are around and I break the capsules.    They call it "Essence".

Sparks 0.
Wow!    What was that? \n
I think I saw someone there. 

111
Sparks 1.
They grow stronger. 

112
Sparks 2.
Burn baby, Burn!


100
Heal 1.
Our ship is being repaired.     \n
Of itself?

101
Heal 2 
These things...   I will call them "Sparks". \n
Looks like they were prisoners. They help us and then go.     Home.

102
Heal 3
Space is a cold place. This doesn't make it any better...    for them.


120
Laser 1
Caution! Lasers!

121
Laser 2
Wzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!

122
Laser 3
I always wanted to see a laser show.

Gravity Shield 1
I guess someone don't like us to be hit.

131
Gravity Shield 2
They focus their hate. I can hear them saying "thieves, thieves ... THIEVES!"  \n
Yes... They stole   something     from  us.

132
Gravity Shield 3
Our bullets hit harder,     a lot harder. Some gravity magic again.

Backup 1
It's a horn! White and silver. Something ancient is engraved on it.  \n
Armed with magnifying glass Samanta found smallest seams.    Looks like it was broken.

141
Backup 2
This ships look oddly familiar.  \n
The piloting is not.

Charge 0
I finished systems analysis.\n
- "Top velocity is higher, and the ship is heavier at the same time".\n
- "Also hitting someone head-on won't damage us".\n
Samanta glanced at the sample and grinned: "Make sure you won't be caught up in the explosion though".
 
Charge 1
More weight, more speed.     More fun!

Charge 2
Collisions heal the ship.    \n
Sounds masohistic.

 
////And even more superior race   than the ones who created that horn   made it whole again.
